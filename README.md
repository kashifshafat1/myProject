# Depot Application

Example code taken from the book [Agile Web Development With Rails 4](https://pragprog.com/book/rails4/agile-web-development-with-rails-4) by Ruby, Tomas and Hansson.

As I progressed through this book tutorial, I updated each chapter results when successful.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/kgish/agile-web-development-with-rails-4.git
